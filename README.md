# OwnageGames
Old project me and a friend tried building from scratch. Sadly it never came to fruition as life threw some curveballs, but I figured I'll upload it for safe keeping :). The basic idea was a site to track current game meta's/reviews/ratings by crawling around game review sites and also depended on users input. Like a open source game archive. We only got to the point where we made the login/registration/general structure for user input/displaying games and some other functions. Soon found out creating crawlers is harder than it looks :P.

The login was fed in through ajax using jqeury. We barely knew any js so it was the quickest way to implement it.

Was a great exploration into my first coding project. To think two newbies got this done in less than 2 months. Goes to show you can achieve alot if you put the work in.
